# ReactiveCocoa, Swift and MVVM

This application is a Swift-port of an MVVM / ReactiveCocoa example application [I wrote a few months ago](https://github.com/ColinEberhardt/ReactiveFlickrSearch).

## Instructions

This project uses a combination of both CocoaPods and git submodules. The reason for this is that the current version of ReactiveCocoa is not compatible with Swift, as [detailed in this blog post](http://www.scottlogic.com/blog/2014/07/24/mvvm-reactivecocoa-swift.html).

This project uses CocoaPods, therefore to get started you must first install the dependencies:

    pod install

Open the workspace in Xcode, and select the ReactiveSwiftFlickrSearch target, build and run.
